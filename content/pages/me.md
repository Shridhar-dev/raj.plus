I'm Raj Kunkolienkar and I believe that I am a master of being a jack of all. I am based out of the lovely city of [Panaji](http://bit.ly/2KjyJaM) in Goa, India. I believe that conversations are an artform, and my strength lies in bringing people together around new experiences in learning. 

I am currently dabbling in entrepreneurship because I find it to be the most effective way of learning about how the world works. However, I must admit that I have learnt as much about myself and the people around me than the world at large. I operate in the field of education because it's a good excuse to work up towards my ultimate goal of learning for a living. I optimize my experiences towards gaining an unique worldview.

Previously, I was a student of physics at [BITS - Pilani](http://bit.ly/2wzA7xC). After stints at [HRI](http://www.hri.res.in) & [CFP, U Porto](https://faraday.fc.up.pt/cfp), I worked on the intersection of quantum information, holography and cosmology. For a while, I flirted with Game Theory, Data Science, Network Science, Sociophysics and Computational Psychiatry before taking a leap into entreprenurship. 

I am currently building [Nova Semita](http://novasemita.com) to empower Indian youth with untapped potential. These days, I think about the future of learning, no-code tools, marketplaces and digital tools for India.

## Questions & Themes of Inquiry

## Music

I am very easy to please, when it comes to different genres of music - across geographies and timelines. These days, I am tuned into Lo-Fi and Chill Hop in the background. Before Spotify became a thing, I used to loop The Beatles, Chopin, Pink Floyd, Andrew Bird, Jack Johnson, Regina Spektor, Sidney Bechet and Norah Jones. You can check out my listening history from the last decade on my [last.fm](http://last.fm/user/rrsk56/). I'd be thankful to the person who gets me to appreciate death metal.

## Timeline

- **1994** – I was born in Goa, India. I remain the only kid in my family. 

- **2002** – I used to go to cybercafes to surf the Internet with my uncle. Remember the days of chatrooms on Yahoo Messenger?

- **2003** – My interest in astronomy skyrocketed upon the death of Kalpana Chawla. I also learnt to use computers (MS Office on Windows 98) and obtained my first E-Mail ID.
